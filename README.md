# SimpleStats

Track pageviews, referrers and devices on your Kirby 3 website.
This plugin provides simple solution for **self-hosted**, **minimal** and **non-intrusive** visitor analytics.

- It tracks referrers to keep track of who links to your website.
- It tracks the device type, the browser engine and the OS family for keeping track of how your website is visited. (without version numbers)
- It tracks page visits, when they are served by Kirby, counting 1 hit per unique user every 24H.

All data is stored in a `.sqlite` database.
A panel allows connected users to visualise the computed stats.

### How it works
- A crypted user-unique fingerprint is stored in order to track unique page views.
The formula is `md5( trunc(IP) + trunc(UserAgent) + Salt )`, which still, according to GDPR, seems to be considered as personal data.
It's stored together with a list of visited pages, a device category (bot/mobile/desktop/tablet/other), the browser's engine (Gecko/Webkit/Blink/Other) and OS Family.
- After 24H, it's processed and any user identifying data is deleted.
  - The visited pages' hit count are incremented
  - Device, Engine and OS Family are separately incremented.
- Referrers are processed immediately and not bound to any user-related identifier.
- All data is summed up on a monthly basis. *There is no weekly or daily precision.*


### Current state
This is very alpha, and has not been tested. It is an initial codebase to be improved.
Discussions and contributions are welcome, as long as the stats stay minimal.

### Configuration

*Soon...*

For now, check the comments in `options.php`, while it's not recommended to change the default behaviour yet.

#### Language setup
Multilanguage websites are supported, but there's only 1 counter for all languages.
Also, the panel view has not been translated.

#### Legal configuration
Depending on your local laws, you might need to sit down and define how personal visitor data is handled.
You might want to inspect the source code to know what's going on in details.
As the license states, there's no guarantee whatsoever.

### Options

*Soon...*

## Panel Interface

*WIP...*

### Charts
Charts are interactive, you can hover them to have details, and click labels to toggle filtering. You can even download a chart as png.

### Tables
Tables are interactive and paginated. You can search data within and sort them by clicking on the column headers.

## Development

Development was started from [a standard Kirby PluginKit](https://github.com/getkirby/pluginkit/tree/4-panel), see [their plugin guide](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/plugins/plugin-setup-basic) for more details on using it.
*These steps are optional, for building development versions.*

- Npm requirements    : `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
- Setup               : `cd /path/to/website/site/plugins/simplestats && npm install`
- While developping   : `npm run dev`
- Publish changes     : `npm run build`
- Update dependencies : `npm update`
